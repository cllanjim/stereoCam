1.  libcam.metadata.so
2.  libcam.metadataprovider.so
3.  libfeatureio.jpg.so
4.  libmmsdkservice.feature

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor\mediatek\proprietary\hardware\mtkcam\legacy\platform\mtxxx\feature\core\effecthal' folder and 
'vendor\mediatek\proprietary\hardware\mtkcam\legacy\platform\mtxxx\feature\core\featureio\pipe' folder.

HOW TO USE IT?
==============

Provide api for camera App to use HW JPEG encode for post processing.
all api interface are at (vendor\mediatek\proprietary\framework\av\service\mmsdk\include)
